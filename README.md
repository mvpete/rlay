Rlay is a development tool that allows you to forward HTTP calls to your local machine through a server. Since rlay's client is connecting to the server, you don't need to open any ports on your local machine to make a local webapp available to the external world. It facilitates the development of web applications when another system needs to call a webhook in your system. It is an easy to deploy, self-hosted alternative to ngrok.

It is composed of two components:

- A server, that you deploy on a machine accessible to the internet, which will receive the HTTP calls, transfer them to the client, then forward the responses.
- A client, that you run on your local machine. It will connect to a) the distant server, b) whatever app you want on your local machine, and proxy the calls made to the server to your machine.

Rlay's code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/cfe84/rlay), as well as a Kubernetes chart, [client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rlay) and [server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rlay-server) are available on npmjs, and a docker image is published to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cfe84/rlay).

# deployment

The recommended deployment is on any kubernetes server you would have dangling around. A helm chart is available in the server's directory, which contains an ingress and certificate.

To make TCP work with Ingress, you need to update the ingress service (a.k.a load balancer) with the additional TCP port:

```yml
    - name: proxied-tcp-444
      protocol: TCP
      port: 444
      targetPort: 444
      nodePort: 32092
```

# setup

On the server: deploy rlay either with docker, npm, or using kubernetes. Set the environment variable `RLAY_PASSWORD` to whatever password you want, and `RLAY_PORT` to the port to be listened. Rlay will not start if a password is not provided.

On your local machine: `npm install -g rlay`, then set an environment variable `RLAY_PASSWORD` to your rlay password, and `RLAY_HOST` to your rlay server DNS, including the protocol (e.g. https://myrlayserver.mydomain.com).

# using

- Start your local dev server, say it's a webapp listening on port 8080.
- Configure whatever remote service needs to call it to point to your rlay server (e.g. https://myrlayserver.mydomain.com)
- Start the rlay client: `rlay --port 8080`

From there on, when the remote service makes http calls, they will be forwarded to your local environment.

# options

-P, --relay-port string   Port on relay server. Default is 443
-H, --relay-host string   Host of relay server
-p, --port string         Local port.
-s, --https               Connect https instead of http.
-o, --output              Output body in console for debug purposes.
-h, --host string         Host of local server. Default is localhost
--password string         Rlay password
-t, --tcp                 Use TCP instead of HTTP
--help                    Display command-line help

# deploy to Azure

Rlay can be deployed to a free Webapp on Azure.

1. Create yourself a free Azure subscription, if you don't have one, then a webapp using Free linux hosting
2. deploy Rlay by configuring in the App Service configuration > Deployment Center > Settings > **External Git repository**. Don't use GitHub unless you forked the project and want to use this fork as a source. Use the _App Service Build Provider_ as Build provider. Setup repo as https://github.com/cfe84/rlay.git
, branch as _main_, then save.
3. Setup password. Go to the webapp settings > Configuration > Application Settings > add a new app setting called `RLAY_PASSWORD`, set whatever password you want.
4. Activate websockets. In the same screen, click on General Settings > Web sockets > on. Click Save.
5. In TLS/SSL settings, turn on "HTTPS only"

Navigate to your web app, after a few minutes it should show `No client connected`. Install the client on your computer. Set environment variables `RLAY_PASSWORD` to the same value as the webapp, and `RLAY_HOST` to the webapp's URL. Be sure to reload whatever terminal you are using to reload the environment. Launch rlay using `rlay --port 8080` (use a port that returns something on your machine). Client should connect and display something like `Connected to https://YOUR_WEB_APP.azurewebsites.net:443`. Refresh your webapp in the browser, it should now forward requests to your client.
